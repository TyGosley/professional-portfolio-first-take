# Be Awesome Productions Portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Description

The project here is designed to use my new skills to showcase I can create a webpage that meets the acceptence criteria

Although I enjoyed this challenge, it highlighted a lot of items that need to be refined, practiced, and developed.  Going into this project, CSS and advanced CSS had still been quite a challenge. I have been exhausting my resources and using study tools like MDN docs and Khan Academy to get these basics down.  The wireframe looks vastly different than my actual product because I realize I just don't have the knowledge or skills yet to bring my vision to life.  This project will be overhauled and redone several times before it looks like my vision.
